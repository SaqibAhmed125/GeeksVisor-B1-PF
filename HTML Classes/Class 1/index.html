        <h1>“THE LAHORE RESOLUTION”</h1>

        Resolved at the Lahore Session of All-India Muslim League held on 22nd-24th March, 1940.

        (1) While approving and endorsing the action taken by the Council and the Working Committee of the All Indian
        Muslim League as indicated in their resolutions dated the 10th of August, 17th and 18th of September and 22nd of
        October, 1939, and 3rd February 1940 on the constitutional issues, this Session of the All-Indian Muslim League
        emphatically reiterates that the scheme of federation embodied in the Government of India Act, 1935, is totally
        unsuited to, and unworkable in the peculiar conditions of this country and is altogether unacceptable to Muslim
        India.

        (2) Resolved that it is the considered view of this Session of the All India Muslim League that no
        constitutional plan would be workable in this country or acceptable to Muslims unless it is designed on the
        following basic principle, namely that geographically contiguous units are demarcated into regions which should
        be so constituted, with such territorial readjustments as may be necessary, that the areas in which the Muslims
        are numerically in a majority as in the North-Western and Eastern Zones of India, should be grouped to
        constitute “Independent States” in which the constituent units shall be autonomous and sovereign.

        (3) That adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards should be specifically provided in the constitution for
        minorities in these units and in these regions for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic,
        political, administrative and other rights and interests in consultation with them; and in other parts of India
        where the Mussalmans are in a minority, adequate, effective and mandatory safeguards shall be specially provided
        in the constitution for them and other minorities for the protection of their religious, cultural, economic,
        political, administrative and other rights and interests in consultation with them.

        (4) This Session further authorizes the Working Committee to frame a scheme of constitution in accordance with
        these basic principles, providing for the assumption finally by the respective regions of all powers such as
        defense, external affairs, communications, customs and such other matters as may be necessary.

        Overall the resolution demanded for the separate Independent region, which was to be formed by grouping the
        states of muslim majority. This session of All India Muslim League was the first time when Muhammad Ali Jinnah
        came forward as a leader who wanted a separate stated composed of states with muslim majority, after realizing
        the basic difference in beliefs of Hindus and Muslims. As otherwise, earlier, he was known as a symbol of Hindu
        Muslim unity in sub-continent.
